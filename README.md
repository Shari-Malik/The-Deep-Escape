# The Deep Escape Project

# Project Overview:
The Deep Escape is an interactive game where two characters, a Shark and a Driver, engage in a chase. The Shark initially moves toward the Driver, shouting "I will kill you", while the Driver attempts to escape, crying "Save Me". Upon collision, their roles swap: the Driver attacks while the Shark retreats. The game ends when the Driver successfully collides with the Shark, displaying the "Shark Escape" message.


# Features:
- Interactive Gameplay: Click the green flag to start the game. The Shark and Driver move toward each other, and when they collide, their actions and roles are swapped.
- Collision-Based Role Swap : When the Shark and Driver collide, the Driver takes on the Shark's role and vice versa.
- End Condition : The game ends when the Driver successfully collides with the Shark, displaying the "Shark Escape" message.
