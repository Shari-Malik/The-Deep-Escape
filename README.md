# The Deep Escape Project

# Project Overview:
The Deep Escape is an interactive game where two characters, a Shark and a Driver, engage in a chase. The Shark initially moves toward the Driver, shouting "I will kill you", while the Driver attempts to escape, crying "Save Me". Upon collision, their roles swap: the Driver attacks while the Shark retreats. The game ends when the Driver successfully collides with the Shark, displaying the "Shark Escape" message.
